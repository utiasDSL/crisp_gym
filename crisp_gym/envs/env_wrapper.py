"""Environment wrappers for extending Gym environments with additional functionality.

This module provides wrappers that add features like observation stacking and receding
horizon control to Gym environments. These wrappers can be used to modify the behavior
of environments without changing their core implementation.

The module includes:
    - WindowWrapper: Stacks a fixed-size window of past observations along a new time dimension
    - RecedingHorizon: Applies a sequence of actions in a receding horizon manner
    - stack_gym_space: Helper function to repeat/stack Gym spaces
