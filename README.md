This repository contains all environments for to train policies using the *crisp_gym* as a backbone.

## Installation

The installation steps are similar to [crisp_py](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_py/tree/feat-ruff-check?tab=readme-ov-file#git-installation-with-pixi) installation.
In particular, if you work on a multi-machine setup, you should check how to setup CycloneDDS / Zenoh.
> ![WARNING] It is important that you set the path for your configuration files.
> Write a script in `scripts/set_env.sh` and export the environment variable:
>```bash
> export CRISP_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config
> # e.g. export CRISP_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/repos/crisp_py/config
>```


## Recording Datasets

You can record datasets in `LeRobotDataset` format by running `python scripts/record_lerobot_dataset.py`.
Check the available options with `-h` to modify the metadata of the dataset created.
You can interactively save episodes using the keyboard to save or delete failed episodes.
For now the data-collection works with:
- [x] Kinesthetic teaching,
- [x]  In a dual arm setup with follower and leader,
- [ ]  Using a motion tracking system like vicon.

It is important to note, that to record a dataset in `lerobot` format, you need to install lerobot.
Lerobot has a lot of dependencies and makes it really hard to install it in your system without breaking some previous config.
[This fork of lerobot](https://github.com/danielsanjosepro/lerobot) has only the dependencies needed to create datasets (which is still quite a lot).

After recording a dataset, you can visualize it using the tools provided by lerobot as well as train a policy with it.
You will then need to install (separetly) a full version of lerobot and not only use the fork mentioned above.
